    <hr>
    <dt>Washington State law does not require motorists to carry tire chains over the major
      mountain passes – why is it different here?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">During extreme weather conditions, Washington state does require chains, even
      on all-wheel and four-wheel drive vehicles, as noted above.
      In addition, Hurricane Ridge is unlike Washington’s mountain passes in a variety
      of ways. At 5,242 feet above sea level Hurricane Ridge is significantly higher in
      elevation than most of Washington’s road-accessible passes and is located on a
      mountain summit, rather than in a more sheltered pass. Further, the Hurricane
      Ridge Road is a park access road and not intended to be as wide or have as many
      safety pullouts as a state highway. </dd>
